		On the 13<sup>th</sup> November 2000 the Frech electronic music duo <em>Daft Punk</em> released the lead single
		<cite>One More Time</cite> of their second studio album <cite>Discovery</cite> that feature lyrics and vocals from
		Texas
		house DJ and singer Romanthony.
	</p>
	<p>
		Two years later the french duo released the remix album <cite>Daft Club</cite> which featured an unplugged version of
		the
		hit track. Here the lyrics were slightly modified, maybe even improvised, specifically in the last verse:

Before the machines take over
And the system gets us in
Just be a lover one more time
Now and against
Daft Punk
Robotic, <strong>Dypnotic</strong>, Romanthony
Doin' it one more time

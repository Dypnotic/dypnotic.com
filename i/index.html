		ヂィプノチィックとは何か
	</h2>
	<p>
		On 13 November 2000, the French electronic music duo <em>Daft Punk</em> released the lead single, <cite>One More
			Time</cite>, from their second studio album, <cite>Discovery</cite>. It features lyrics and vocals by Texas house
		DJ
		and singer Romanthony.
	</p>
	<p>
		Two years later, the French duo released the remix album <cite>Daft Club</cite>. It features an unplugged version of
		the hit track, with lyrics that were slightly altered, perhaps even improvised, especially in the last verse:

Before the machines take over
And the system gets us in
Just be a lover one more time
Now and against
Daft Punk
Robotic, <strong>Dypnotic</strong>, Romanthony
Doin' it one more time

	<p>Teenage me thought this was <ruby lang=ja>めっちゃ<rt lang=en>super</rt></ruby> <ruby lang=ja>かっこいい<rt lang=en>cool</rt>
		</ruby> (I still do). It was
		obscure, unique and meant nothing. So I made it my own.

		<p class="translation" lang=en>Why Japanese?</p>
		なぜ日本語なのか
	</h2>
	<p>
		At the time of writing, I am currently learning Japanese. As a huge gaming and anime enthusiast I want to be
		able to watch and understand Japanese media without having a layer of translation. Using Japanese in titles and
		occasionally elsewhere is my way of having fun with it, so I do not get bored.
